#Robotron 2084


In order to run this, you need to run a series of commands. This is the only order that works:

	- Unzip
	- cd "Website Code"		- This changes to the web code folder
	- python app.py			- This starts up the web server, if this fails, the game can still run, with reduced features
	- cd ..				- Change back to root
	- cd "Game Code"		- Changes to the game code
	- python main.py		- This runs the game code
 
To play:
	Read the screen, so SPACE to start the game, and then WASD to move, and IJKL to shoot.
